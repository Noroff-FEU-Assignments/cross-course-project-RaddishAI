    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">You should always have security in your thoughts when creating a webpage. <br>
                                Which and how strict policies you are going to have on your page is also different depending on what you are planning to use your page for. <br>
                                Some types of threats are both common and something that you should be prepared for on every page, and other pages there are more specific threats.<br> 
                                If you are going to have a log in service, where you store passwords, you need to have an efficient but safe way to both create and renew passwords, <br>
                                and you also need to decrypt them in a way which keeps them safe for the user. <br>
                                If your page is an informational platform where the user can go and check for easy information without needing to log in or to store any privacy data, <br>
                                you are not required to have the same high level security levels to protect your site. In such a case, you are maybe more worried about DDOS/DOS and <br>
                                needs to implement security measures to cope with those threats. </p>
